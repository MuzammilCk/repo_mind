Absolute Rules for the AI

Do NOT invent files, tools, APIs, or behaviors

Operate ONLY inside the current phase + module

If a dependency is missing → STOP and report

Never assume tool output formats

Never skip steps

Never jump phases

If unsure → return BLOCKED: NEED INPUT

All outputs must be deterministic & reproducible

No “future improvements”, “ideas”, or “optimizations” unless explicitly asked

No auto-refactoring or architecture changes
